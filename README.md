# 🚗🔋 EV Battery Management System using Deep Learning

This project leverages deep learning techniques, particularly LSTM neural networks, to optimize Electric Vehicle (EV) battery performance and management. Using real-world battery charging data, the model predicts essential battery health metrics and charging behavior. It also features a user-friendly Gradio interface and integrates with Comet ML for experiment tracking and visualization.

## 🔍 Project Description
